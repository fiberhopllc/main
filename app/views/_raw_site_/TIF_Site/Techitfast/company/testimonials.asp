I initially decided on  updating my IT infrastructure and I wanted to have a sense of security over my  most vital business information. I had a wide variety of options and decided on  an inexpensive bundled solution, which restored my in-house server into a cloud  solution. Overall, my entire network infrastructure had less equipment to  monitor and more efficient.” - <strong>Cindy S. Buffalo Grove, IL</strong></em></p>
					<p style="background:#EEE; border:1px; border-color:#AAA; border-style:solid;padding:10px; color:#555; margin-bottom:30px"><em> “I originally used a simple Google email  account to communicate with my small business staff.  At first, I never had any issues or  difficulty scheduling appointments and contacting my clients. Tech IT Fast,  Inc. was able to introduce and integrate me into a Microsoft Exchange Server  System, which was wonderfully customized in the bundled solution. I was able to  have all of my emails transferred and experienced a better overall production  throughout my business using Exchange. Setting up appointments, multiple group  emails and selective documents to be shared and   viewed by my entire work staff and privatize certain appointments were a  successful trend caused by Tech IT Fast, Inc. Overall, Tech IT Fast were very  professional and punctual at every scheduled   appointment, with the promised services. They were able to work with my  budget and delivered on a big promise, which was more than I expected.“ - <strong> Phil C. Chicago, IL</strong></em></p>

The overall  experience has been excellent. Seeing us through a server melt down in the  middle of tax season. Most recently helping get through moving offices which  required running new wires. We've stayed because the service has been  consistently great over the years. The projects have always been completed and  done properly. The techs are friendly and available when we need them.
