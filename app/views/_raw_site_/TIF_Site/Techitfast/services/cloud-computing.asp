      <p>Are you trying to achieve the <strong>highest level of functionality, manageability and efficiency</strong> on everything from your desktop, server, cloud and beyond? Tech IT Fast, Inc. can turn all this and more into a reality.</p>
      <p>With <strong>virtualization</strong>, an entire closet full of servers can be consolidated to just a handful, allowing your business to minimize IT expenses and opening up a host of advanced disaster recovery options.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Cloud</strong> offers a wide range of advantages over conventional servers. Here are a few:</p>

    <div class="comp"  style="width:660px; height:314px">
      <div class="row"><span class="comp_lt"></span><span class="comp_ts"></span><span class="comp_rt"></span></div>
      <div class="row"><span class="comp_ls"></span><span class="comp_content"><img src="../../public/images/supporting_images/Cloud_Computing_Comp_BG.png" style="margin-left:8px"></span><span class="comp_rs"></span></div>
      <div class="row"><span class="comp_lb"></span><span class="comp_bs"></span><span class="comp_rb"></span></div>
    </div>

      <p> Virtualization reduces overall costs in a number of ways. Most importantly, by being in the Cloud, your servers are <strong>future-proof</strong>. With that, staying in tune with current technology is no longer a seperate, costly project.</p>
      <p>On top of that, consolidating your servers into the Cloud reduces the amount of power and cooling needed significantly, as well as the amount of support needed to maintain as many servers or more is also reduced by enterprise management features.</p>
