			<div class="content_pad_<%=layout%>"> Managed IT Services is an innovative approach of providing Business IT Support, where an IT Service Provider proactively monitors and remediates (resolves) issues with the clients’ network, servers, desktops, and all networked IT Infrastructure. Traditional IT Support, also referred to as “break-fix” was a reactive approach to solving IT problems that a business faced. When something stopped working, support would be called upon to investigate the cause and fix it. This led to a huge lag time between the problem occurrence and its resolution.
				<p> Managed IT Solutions approach continuously censors a client network for problems using advanced monitoring tools. A Senior IT consultant and team are immediately notified when an issue arises and can act fast to resolve it, most times these events occur before end-users are aware of any disruption.</p>
